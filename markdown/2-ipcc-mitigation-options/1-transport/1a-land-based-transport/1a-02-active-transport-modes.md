[@ipccar6wg3ClimateChange20222022] defines active transport modes as:

> Active travel is travel that requires physical effort, for example journeys made by walking or cycling.

Active transport is outlined in section 10.2.1 of [@ipccar6wg3ClimateChange20222022].

# Mitigation Objective

The primary goal is for a shift from light-duty vehicles to walking and cycling for short journeys (5km or less).


# Mitigation Potential


!!! potential

    The literature referenced by the IPCC WG3 indicates a realistic mitigation
     potential span of 2-10% of emissions from ICE vehicles.





> Case studies suggest that active mobility could reduce emissions from urban transport by 2% to 10% depending on the setting (Creutzig et al. 2016; Zahabi et al. 2016; Keall et al. 2018; Gilby et al. 2019; Neves and Brand 2019; Bagheri et al. 2020; Ivanova et al. 2020; Brand et al. 2021).

> The mitigation potentials from reductions in transport activity consider, for example, that “walking and cycle track networks can provide 20 % (5–40 % in sensitivity analyses) induced walking and cycle journeys that would not have taken place without the new networks, and around 15 % (0–35 % in sensitivity analyses) of current journeys less than 5 km made by car or public transport can be replaced by walking or cycling” (Sælensminde, 2004).

> Modeling studies of health and climate change in the context of urban transport show that a modal shift from car and motorcycle use toward walking and cycling could reduce GHG emissions by 38% in London and 47% in Delhi in 2030.

> A reduction of close to 2% in GHG emissions is observed for an increase of 7% in the length of the bicycle network.

> As in other studies, it is found that cycling infrastructure accessibility is positively linked to bicycle usage, playing a positive role in reducing transportation GHG emissions, by shifting the mode share of bikes. Although this effect may appear small (about 1.7%), it is as big as the estimates we have found in our previous research when converting all the transit diesel buses to hybrid technology and electrifying the commuter trains in Montreal at the same time

>... we estimated that shifting 41% of short car trips to walking and cycling had the potential to mitigate carbon emissions from car travel by 4.5%, or 1.15 KgCO₂-eq per person per week. This is equivalent to a mitigation potential from all surface transport of 4%.
