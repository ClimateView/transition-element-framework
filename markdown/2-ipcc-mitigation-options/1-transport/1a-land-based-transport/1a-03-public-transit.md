Public transit, also known as public transportation or mass transit, refers to a system of transport services available for use by the general public. These services typically operate on set routes and schedules, and are designed to move large numbers of people efficiently.

Public transit is outlined in sections 10.2.2 (shift: mode choice for urban and intercity transport) and 10.4.2 of [@ipccar6wg3ClimateChange20222022].


# Mitigation Objective

The primary goal is for a shift from light-duty vehicles to public transit alternatives for short and medium journeys (25km or less).

# Mitigation Potential




!!! potential

    The AR6 report and the literature referenced by it do not present 
    any reliable estimates for the mitigation potential of a shift to 
    public transit.



>A shift to public transit modes can likely offer significant emissions reductions, but estimates are uncertain.
