This mitigation option covers both teleworking (i.e. working from home)  and videoconferencing as an alternative to travelling to a meeting.

Teleworking is outlined in section 10.2.3 (digitalisation) of [@ipccar6wg3ClimateChange20222022].

# Mitigation Objective

The primary goal is for a utilisation shift to reduce light-duty vehicle distances travelled in a city by means of digital solutions such as increased teleworking and videoconferencing.

# Mitigation Potential


!!! potential

    The AR6 report indicates a conservative mitigation potential of 1% of 
    total light-duty vehicle emissions.





> A move towards a digital economy that allows workers to work and access information remotely could reduce travel demand. Case studies suggest that teleworking could reduce transport emissions by 20% in some instances, but likely by 1%, at most, across the entire transport system (Roth et al. 2008; O’Keefe et al. 2016; Shabanpour et al. 2018; O’Brien and Aliabadi 2020).

> We found that telecommuting has the potential to reduce GHG and PM2.5 emissions by up to 0.7% and 1.14%, respectively.

## Analysis of telecommuting behavior and impacts on travel demand and the environment

This study[@shabanpourAnalysisTelecommutingBehavior2018] implemented activity-based models to simulate the potential impacts of telecommuting in three distinct scenarios: a base-case of 12% of workers with flexible work schedules allowing for telecommuting, vs 25% and 50% levels. The conclusion was that in the best scenario, flex-50, GHG emission reductions of 0.7% was possible.


## Dematerialization Through Electronic Media?

Although this study [@coroamaDematerializationElectronicMedia2014] focusses on dematerialization, the impact of remote meetings is also discussed in depth. The paper notes that macro level analysis of telepresence systems could indicate a mitigation potential as high as 1% of total global emissions which would translate to approximately 6% of global transport sector emissions and  9.6% of road based emissions (assuming that the transport sector accounts for 15% of global emissions and 69% of this is road based).
