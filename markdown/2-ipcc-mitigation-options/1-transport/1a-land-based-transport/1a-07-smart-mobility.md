Smart mobility is a broad term that covers the use of technology in order to improve utilisation and efficiency of transport solutions. 

Smart mobility is outlined in section 10.2.3 (digitalisation) of [@ipccar6wg3ClimateChange20222022].


# Mitigation Objective

The primary objective is for a utilisation shift to increase the energy efficiency of light-duty vehicles in a city by means of technology (ICT) based efficiency and utilisation improvements.

# Mitigation Potential


!!! potential

    The AR6 report and the literature referenced by it do not present 
    any reliable estimates for the mitigation potential of smart
    mobility.



> 	ICT and smart city technologies can be used to improve the efficiency of operating the transport system. Furthermore, smart technologies can improve competitiveness of transit and active transport over personal vehicle use by streamlining mobility options to compete with private cars. The effect of smart mobility on the GHG emissions from the transport sector is uncertain (Creutzig 2021).
