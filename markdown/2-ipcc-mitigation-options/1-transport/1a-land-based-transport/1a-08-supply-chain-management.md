Supply chain management entails efficiency improvements in logistics planning for freight. Route optimisation, load optimisation and eco-driving are examples of supply chain management solutions.

Supply chain management is outlined in section 10.2 (table 10.3) of [@ipccar6wg3ClimateChange20222022].


# Mitigation Objective

The primary objective is for a utilisation shift to reduce freight distances travelled by means of logistics improvements.

# Mitigation Potential


!!! potential

    The AR6 report and the literature referenced by it do not present 
    any reliable estimates for the mitigation potential of supply chain
     management.



> 	Supply chains could be optimised to reduce the movement or travel distance of product components. Logistics planning could optimise the use of transport infrastructure to increase utilisation rates and decrease travel. The effect of these strategies on the GHG emissions from the transport sector is uncertain.

> The results indicate that the most implemented sustainable initiatives in reducing GHG emissions are: eco-driving, eco-routing (routing and scheduling), increasing vehicle carrying capacity, improving freight logistics and utilising lightweight vehicle construction. Inefficient and unsafe driving habits not only affect GHG emissions but also increase vehicle operating costs (e.g. higher fuel consumption and maintenance costs), insurance costs (i.e. increased risk profile) and damage corporate image. These results are strongly aligned with the literature, which indicate that eco-driving is an important strategy to reduce operating costs and associated risks.

## Sustainable supply chain initiatives

This paper [@makanSustainableSupplyChain2018] investigates GHG emission reduction from various supply chain initiatives for road freight in South Africa. Various initiatives are analysed and scored for potential to impact GHG emissions - however no concrete mitigation potentials are presented.
