E-commerce is the activity of consumer purchasing of goods occurring online instead of consumers travelling by light-duty vehicles to shopping locations in order to make purchases. E-commerce effectively trades vehicle kilometers travelled by light-duty vehicles for light trucks ("last mile delivery").

E-commerce is outlined in section 10.2 (table 10.3) of [@ipccar6wg3ClimateChange20222022].


# Mitigation Objective

The primary goal is for a shift from travel by light-duty vehicles (for the purposes of shopping) to freight shipping by light trucks.

# Mitigation Potential


!!! potential

    The AR6 report and the literature referenced by it do not present 
    any reliable estimates for the mitigation potential of e-commerce.


> The effect of e-commerce on transport emissions is uncertain. Increased e-commerce would reduce demand for trips to stores but could increase  demand for freight transport (particularly last-mile delivery) (Jaller and Pahwa 2020; Le et al. 2021).

> Resulting estimates show that e-commerce has cut VMT by 7%, while consistent with previous literature, a potential reduction of 87% is possible if all individuals were to substitute towards online shopping. However, it is important to note that individuals using public transit, walking or biking to a store, can instead produce net gains in the externalities if they substitute towards online shopping. While this study assumes a 100% modal share of personal vehicles for shopping-related travel, the true modal shares are 79% in SF and 94% in Dallas, so a 7% reduction in VMT and a potential 87% reduction represent upper bound values for the same.

> The empirical evidence remains scattered with sometimes contradictory findings. This complicates the forecasting of impacts of online shopping on passenger and freight traffic patterns, urban form, and air quality.

## Evaluating the environmental impacts of online shopping

This paper [@jallerEvaluatingEnvironmentalImpacts2020] modeled  shopping behaviour in Dallas and San Francisco in order to establish the mitigation potential of e-commerce. The paper estimates that vehicle kilometers travelled in the cities studied has already been reduced by 7% since the inception of e-commerce and estimates a somewhat high potential of 87% reduction in light-duty vehicle distances if all shopping is shifted to e-commerce.


## Impacts of online shopping on travel demand

This paper [@leImpactsOnlineShopping2021] is a literature review of 42 studies conducted between 1990 and 2020. Studies are divided into four categories of conclusions: e-commerce as a substitute for shopping, as a complement (i.e. leads to increased shopping travel), as a modifier of shopping travel, or neutral effects on shopping travel. The paper concludes that a slight majority of studies show that e-commerce is a substitute for shopping but note that results are mixed.
