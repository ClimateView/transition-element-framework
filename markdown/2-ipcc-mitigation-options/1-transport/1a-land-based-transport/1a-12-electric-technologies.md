Electric vehicle technologies encompass battery electric vehicles (BEVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), each offering a pathway to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reliance on fossil fuels. BEVs operate solely on electricity stored in batteries, producing zero emissions during operation. HEVs combine an internal combustion engine with an electric motor to improve fuel efficiency, using regenerative braking to recharge the battery. PHEVs feature a larger battery than HEVs, allowing for extended electric-only driving and the option to recharge via an external power source. The adoption of these technologies contributes to reducing emissions in the transportation sector, especially when powered by renewable energy sources. However, challenges such as battery production impacts, charging infrastructure, and range limitations remain to be addressed for widespread implementation.

Electric technologies are outlined in section 10.3.2 of [@ipccar6wg3ClimateChange20222022].

# Mitigation Objective

The primary goal is for a shift from ICE light-duty vehicles to electric light-duty vehicles.

# Mitigation Potential


!!! potential

    The AR5 report estimates the mitigation potential of Battery Electric  Vehicles at 85%.


> The literature suggests that current BEVs, if manufactured on low-carbon electricity as well as operated on low-carbon electricity would have footprints as low 22 gCO₂-eq pkm–1 for a compact-sized car (Ellingsen et al. 2014; Ellingsen et al. 2016). This value suggests a reduction potential of around 85% compared to similarly-sized fossil fuel vehicles (median values).

> Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) emit no tailpipe emissions and have potentially very low fuel-production emissions (when using low-car bon electricity generation) (Kromer and Heywood, 2007). BEVs operate at a drive-train efficiency of around 80 % compared with about 20–35 % for conventional ICE LDVs.

## The Size and Range Effect

This study [@ellingsenSizeRangeEffect2016] analysed how increasing battery size and driving range of BEVs affects their environmental impact over the full lifecycle. Four groups of car sizes (mini, medium, large and luxury) were analysed and lifecycle emissions for BEVs compared to those of ICE vehicles.
