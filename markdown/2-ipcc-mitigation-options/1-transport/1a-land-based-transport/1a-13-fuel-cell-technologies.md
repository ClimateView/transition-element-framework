Fuel cell technology involves the use of electrochemical cells that convert the chemical energy of a fuel, typically hydrogen, directly into electricity through a reaction with oxygen, producing water and heat as by-products. Unlike combustion engines, fuel cells generate electricity without burning fuel, resulting in zero emissions of pollutants at the point of use. Hydrogen fuel cells are particularly noted for their high efficiency and potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions when hydrogen is produced from renewable sources.

Fuel cell technologies are outlined in section 10.3.3 of [@ipccar6wg3ClimateChange20222022].

# Mitigation Objective

The primary goal is for a shift from ICE light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles to fuel cell equivalent vehicles.

# Mitigation Potential


!!! potential

    The AR6 report and the literature referenced by it do not present 
    any reliable estimates for the mitigation potential of fuel cell 
    technologies. This is owing, in part, to the large variation in 
    emissions from hydrogen production.


 > Current literature covering lifecycle impacts of FCVs shows that vehicles fuelled with hydrogen produced from steam methane reforming of natural gas offer little or no mitigation potential over ICEVs. Other available hydrogen fuel chains vary widely in carbon intensity, depending on the synthesis method and the energy source used (electrolysis or steam methane reforming; fossil fuels or renewables). The least carbon-intensive hydrogen pathways rely on electrolysis powered by low-carbon electricity. Compared to ICEVs and BEVs, FCVs for LDVs are at a lower technology readiness level, as discussed in section 10.3.

> FCEVs can provide the mobility service of today’s conventional cars at potentially very low-carbon emissions. Deploying a 25% share of FCEVs in road transport by 2050 can contribute up to 10% of all cumulative transport-related carbon emission reductions necessary to move from an ETP 6°C Scenario (6DS) to a 2DS, depending on the region.

## Hydrogen and Fuel Cells

This report [@oecdHydrogenFuelCells2015] by the International Energy Agency examines the role of hydrogen as a versatile energy carrier and the potential of fuel cells in contributing to a sustainable energy future. The report explores the current state of hydrogen production, the technological advancements in fuel cells, and the opportunities for integrating hydrogen into various sectors such as transportation, industry, and power generation. It highlights the benefits of hydrogen in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing energy security, as well as the challenges related to production costs, infrastructure development, and policy frameworks. The report provides policy recommendations to support the adoption of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies and emphasises the need for international collaboration to accelerate their deployment as part of a low-carbon energy transition.
