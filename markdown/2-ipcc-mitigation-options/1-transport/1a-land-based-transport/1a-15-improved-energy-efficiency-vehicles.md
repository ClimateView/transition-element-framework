Improved energy efficiency for vehicles involves optimizing vehicle design, technology, and operations to reduce energy consumption and emissions. Enhancements include advanced aerodynamics, efficient powertrains, low rolling resistance tires, and better thermal management systems. Technological advancements such as turbocharging, direct fuel injection, and cylinder deactivation in internal combustion engines contribute to higher fuel efficiency.  While these advancements offer significant benefits, they require ongoing innovation, investment, and consumer acceptance to achieve widespread adoption and impact.

Improved energy efficiency for vehicles is listed in table 10.1 of [@ipccar6wg3ClimateChange20222022] and section 8.3.1 of [@ipccar5wg3ClimateChange20142014].


# Mitigation Objective

The primary goal is for an efficiency shift to increase energy efficiency of all vehicle types.

# Mitigation Potential


!!! potential

    The AR6 report does not present a single estimate for the mitigation 
	 potential of improved energy efficiency, however a table of potentials 
	 is given for various technological solutions. We estimate a conservative 
	 35% net total potential for these solutions.


 
> Both the integrated and sectoral model literature present energy efficiency measures as having the greatest promise and playing the largest role for emission reductions in the short term (Skinner et al., 2010; Harvey, 2012; IEA, 2009; McKinnon and Piecyk, 2009; Sorrell et al., 2012).

> The potential GHG emissions resulting from improvements in the technical energy efficiency of vehicles were estimated in another scenario in SULTAN, which concluded that these could deliver a reduction in transport‘s GHG emissions of 12% on 1990 levels by 2050.

> Several LD[V] gasoline concepts are achieving 10-15% and some up to 35% reductions relative to GDI (gasoline direct injection) engines of today. Projections indicate tight CO₂ regulations will require some degree of hybridization and/or high-performing gasoline and diesel engines. Scoping work on HD[V] engines is reported on achieving 55% BTE (break thermal efficiency) using methods that can reasonably be commercialized.
