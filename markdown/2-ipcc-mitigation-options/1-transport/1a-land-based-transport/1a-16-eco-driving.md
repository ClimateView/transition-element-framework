**Eco-driving** refers to a set of driving practices aimed at improving fuel efficiency, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and minimising wear and tear on vehicles. These practices include maintaining a steady speed, accelerating and braking smoothly, using higher gears, and anticipating traffic flow to avoid unnecessary stops. Eco-driving also encourages regular vehicle maintenance, such as proper tyre inflation and engine tuning, to enhance performance. By adopting these techniques, drivers can achieve significant reductions in fuel consumption and emissions. Eco-driving is applicable to various modes of transport, including cars, trucks, and buses, and represents an accessible strategy for individuals and organisations to contribute to sustainability goals. The effectiveness of eco-driving relies on driver education and behavioural change, as well as supportive policies and incentives.

Eco-driving for vehicles is listed in table 5.1 of [@ipccar6wg3ClimateChange20222022] and outlined in section 8.3.5 of [@ipccar5wg3ClimateChange20142014].


# Mitigation Objective

The primary goal is for an efficiency shift to increase energy efficiency of all vehicle types by means of eco-driving.

# Mitigation Potential


!!! potential

    The AR5 report estimates the potential of eco-driving to 5-10% for LDVs 
    and 5-20% for HDVs.


 
> Eco-Driving: A 5–10 % improvement in on-road fuel economy can be achieved for LDVs through efforts to promote ‘eco-driving’ (An et al., 2011; IEA, 2012d). Fuel efficiency improvements from ecodriving for HDVs are in the 5–20 % range (AEA, 2011).

> Eco-driving (including avoiding rapid starts and stops, and early shifting for manual transmission cars) could improve average fuel use by 10% or more, and eco-driving training appears to be a very cost-effective way of improving fuel economy. Many fleet operators understand the potential and organise training programmes to encourage or require their drivers to apply driving styles that save fuel.

> Eco-driving training can improve safety, reduce driver stress, and increase fuel efficiency by 5-20%, making it attractive to both drivers and employers.
