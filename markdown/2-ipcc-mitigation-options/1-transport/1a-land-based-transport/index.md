Land-based transport plays a crucial role in global mobility, covering the movement of people and goods through road, rail, and pipeline systems. It is the dominant contributor to transport-related greenhouse gas emissions  (approximately **12%** of global CO₂-eq emissions), driven primarily by road vehicles such as cars, trucks, and buses. Mitigation efforts in this sub-sector focus on electrification, improving vehicle fuel efficiency, shifting towards public and active transport, and adopting low-carbon fuels. These strategies offer significant potential to reduce emissions, while addressing the growing demand for mobility, particularly in urban areas.


# Mitigation Potential
TBD.


# Mitigation Options

Chapter 10 [@ipccar6wg3ClimateChange20222022] discusses a number of mitigation options for the transport sector which are indexed in the table below. A small number of mitigations options only covered in Chapter 8 of the AR5 report [@ipccar5wg3ClimateChange20142014] are also included here for completeness.

# Emissions
We estimate that the land-based transport sub-sector was accountable for 12.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions for 2020 (5,919 MtCO₂-eq , see [GHG Emissions](/5-resources/4-reference/3-ghg-emissions.md)). This can be further broken down into 0.5% (228 MtCO₂-eq) for rail transport and 12% (5,691 MtCO₂-eq) for road transport.

See [E-1A3b - Road Transportation](/2-ipcc-mitigation-options/ipcc-2019-emissions/1-energy/1a-fuel-combustion-activities/1a3-transport/1a3b-road-transportation.md) for a summary of IPCC guidelines for emission reporting.
