Aviation is a fast-growing subsector of transport and a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions (approximately **1.2%** of global CO₂-eq emissions), particularly due to its reliance on fossil jet fuels and the long distances covered by commercial flights. While aviation accounts for a smaller share of global emissions compared to road transport, its impact is magnified by the high-altitude release of pollutants. Mitigation options for aviation include improving aircraft fuel efficiency, developing sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs), electrifying short-haul flights, and optimising air traffic management. However, reducing emissions in this sector remains challenging due to the long lifecycle of aircraft and the need for large-scale technological innovations to meet the sector’s decarbonisation goals.


# Mitigation Potential
TBD.


# Mitigation Options

Chapter 10 [@ipccar6wg3ClimateChange20222022] discusses a number of mitigation options for the transport sector which are indexed in the table below. A small number of mitigations options only covered in Chapter 8 of the AR5 report [@ipccar5wg3ClimateChange20142014] are also included here for completeness.

# Emissions
We estimate that the aviation sub-sector was accountable for 1.2% of global greenhouse gas emissions for 2020 (584 MtCO₂-eq , see [GHG Emissions](/5-resources/4-reference/3-ghg-emissions.md)).

See [E-1A3a - Civil Aviation](/2-ipcc-mitigation-options/ipcc-2019-emissions/1-energy/1a-fuel-combustion-activities/1a3-transport/1a3a-civil-aviation.md) for a summary of IPCC guidelines for emission reporting.
