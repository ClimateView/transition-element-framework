Shipping is a critical sub-sector of global transport, responsible for moving around 80% of world trade by volume and generating **1.7%** of global CO₂-eq emissions. It is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, particularly through the use of heavy fuel oil in large vessels. Mitigating emissions in shipping involves improving energy efficiency through better ship design and operational practices, adopting alternative fuels such as ammonia, hydrogen, and biofuels, and integrating renewable energy technologies like wind assistance. Decarbonising shipping is particularly challenging due to the long lifespan of ships and the scale of infrastructure required for fuel transitions, but significant opportunities exist to reduce emissions through international cooperation, regulation, and technological advancements.


# Mitigation Potential
TBD.


# Mitigation Options

Chapter 10 [@ipccar6wg3ClimateChange20222022] discusses a number of mitigation options for the transport sector which are indexed in the table below. A small number of mitigations options only covered in Chapter 8 of the AR5 report [@ipccar5wg3ClimateChange20142014] are also included here for completeness.

# Emissions
We estimate that the shipping sub-sector was accountable for 1.7% of global greenhouse gas emissions for 2020 (801 MtCO₂-eq, see [GHG Emissions](/5-resources/4-reference/3-ghg-emissions.md)).
