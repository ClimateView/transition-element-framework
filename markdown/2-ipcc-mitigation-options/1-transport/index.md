<h1 class="cv-h2">M-1 - Transport</h1>

The transport sector is a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, responsible for approximately **16%** of global CO₂-eq emissions. This sector encompasses all modes of transportation, including road, rail, maritime, and aviation, as well as the infrastructure supporting these systems. It addresses emissions from both passenger and freight transport, covering a wide range of vehicles, from personal cars and trucks to commercial ships and airplanes.

As the sector continues to grow, particularly in developing regions, the challenge of mitigating its impact becomes increasingly urgent. Effective mitigation strategies within the transport sector include decarbonising vehicles, transitioning to low-carbon fuels, shifting to less carbon-intensive modes of transport, and improving overall system efficiency.

Technological advancements, coupled with policy interventions and behavioural changes, offer substantial potential to reduce emissions. Electrification of road vehicles, particularly passenger cars and light-duty trucks, represents a critical pathway, complemented by the integration of renewable energy into the transport energy mix. Additionally, the optimisation of logistics and the promotion of public and active transport modes can significantly contribute to emissions reduction. However, deploying these solutions requires consideration of regional disparities, economic viability, and the need for supportive infrastructure and regulatory frameworks to achieve substantial, long-term mitigation outcomes across all transport modes.


# Mitigation Potential
TBD.


# Mitigation Options

Chapter 10 [@ipccar6wg3ClimateChange20222022] discusses a number of mitigation options for the transport sector which are indexed in the table below. A small number of mitigations options only covered in Chapter 8 of the AR5 report [@ipccar5wg3ClimateChange20142014] are also included here for completeness.  

For indexing this sector we have chosen to use the three major sub-sectors covered in AR6:

# Emissions

We estimate that the transport sector was accountable for 15.8% of global greenhouse gas emissions for 2020 (7,499 MtCO₂-eq, see [GHG Emissions](/5-resources/4-reference/3-ghg-emissions.md)). 

See [E-1A3 - Transport](/2-ipcc-mitigation-options/ipcc-2019-emissions/1-energy/1a-fuel-combustion-activities/1a3-transport/index.md) for a summary of IPCC guidelines for emission reporting.

# TODO

Harmonise with AR6 WG3, chapter 5:


- 5.3.1 Efficient Service Provision
	- Mobility (passenger-km)
		- Avoid:
			- Integrate transport and land-use planning 
			- Smart logistics 
			- Teleworking 
			- Compact cities 
			- Fewer long-haul flights 
			- Local holidays
		- Shift:
			- Modal shifts, from car to cycling, walking, or public transit 
			- Modal shift from air travel to high-speed rail
		- Improve:
			- Lightweight vehicles 
			- Hydrogen vehicles 
			- Electric vehicles 
			- Eco-driving
