**Energy efficiency** aims to reduce the amount of energy needed to produce goods and services across industries such as steel, cement, and chemicals. This is achieved by upgrading technologies, improving process designs, and reducing energy losses. Key strategies include enhancing insulation, upgrading machinery to more efficient models, recovering waste heat, and optimising energy use through automation and process control systems. Precision manufacturing and energy management systems also play a crucial role in reducing unnecessary energy consumption. By adopting these advanced technologies, industries can lower their overall energy demand, cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and improve competitiveness, all while maintaining or increasing production capacity.
