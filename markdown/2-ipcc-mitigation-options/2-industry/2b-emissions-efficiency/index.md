title: M-2B - Emissions Efficiency and Fuel Switching
progress: 1
class: node
sector: industry
---

**Emissions efficiency** focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy or material used in industrial processes. This strategy involves adopting **low-carbon energy sources** (like renewables) and switching to **lower-carbon fuels** (such as natural gas, hydrogen, or biofuels). Additionally, **feedstock decarbonisation** plays a critical role by replacing carbon-intensive raw materials (e.g., fossil fuels) with **low-carbon alternatives** like biomass or green hydrogen. Technologies like **carbon capture and storage (CCS)** and **carbon capture and utilisation (CCU)** also contribute by capturing emissions from processes that cannot be easily decarbonised. Together, these measures help industries reduce emissions while maintaining production levels.

# Mitigation Potential
TBD.

Chapter 11 [@ipccar6wg3ClimateChange20222022] discusses a number of CCU/CCS focussed mitigation options for the industry sector which are indexed in the table below. 

- Electrification
- Fuel switching, such as low-carbon hydrogen
- Feedstock decarbonisation
- Process optimisations
