title: M-2C - Material Efficiency (Production and Product Design)
progress: 1
class: node
sector: industry
---

**Material efficiency** focuses on minimising the use of raw materials in industrial production through better design, optimised resource use, and enhanced recycling and reuse practices. This strategy also includes **substituting high-carbon materials** with lower-impact alternatives and embracing **circular economy principles** to keep materials in circulation for longer. By designing products for longevity, reuse, and recyclability, industries can significantly reduce material consumption, lower production costs, and cut emissions associated with material extraction and processing. Additionally, **sufficiency** and **material stock efficiency improvements** play a key role by promoting downsizing, extending product lifespans, and adopting resource-efficient construction techniques. Together, these approaches reduce the demand for new material production, lessen energy use, and lower emissions, all while maintaining functionality and durability across products and infrastructure.


> The Kaya-like identity presented earlier in the chapter (Equation 11.1) suggests that material demand can be decoupled from population and economic development by two means: (i) reducing the accumulated material stock (MStock) used to deliver material services; and (ii) reducing the material (MPR + MSE) required to maintain material stocks (MStock).

# Mitigation Options

Chapter 11 [@ipccar6wg3ClimateChange20222022] discusses a number of demand-side mitigation options for the industry sector which are indexed in the table below. 

- **Design with less**: Creating infrastructure and products with fewer materials through innovative design, such as lightweight construction or modular buildings​  
- **Design for reuse or repurposing**: Ensuring that products and materials can be easily reused, repurposed, or recycled at the end of their lifecycle​
- **Improved material utilisation**: Enhancing the efficiency of how materials are used during the production process, minimising waste and ensuring more precise material usage​
