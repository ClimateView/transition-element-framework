title: M-2D - Using Products More Intensively
progress: 1

**Using products more intensively** refers to maximising the use of existing products and infrastructure by increasing their frequency of use or sharing them among multiple users. This strategy includes practices such as product-sharing models (e.g., car-sharing, tool libraries) where a single product serves many users, thereby reducing the overall need for new products. It also involves designing products to be used continuously at high capacity, rather than underutilised, extending their functional life through better maintenance and reducing idle time. By intensifying product use, industries can decrease the demand for new production, lower material and energy consumption, and reduce waste, ultimately leading to reduced emissions.

# Mitigation Options

Chapter 11 [@ipccar5wg3ClimateChange20142014] discusses mitigation options for product intensity in the industry sector which are indexed in the table below. 

AR5 Section 10.1 outlines a simplified decomposition of emissions, defining *product-service intensity* as the quantity of service delivered per unit of product. Products are divided into *consumables* and *durables* - each with a single fundamental mitigation option. Mitigation options for consumables - whose service delivered is short-lived - focus on more precise doses of the product in order to minimise waste. For durables - whose service is provided over potentially many years - mitigation options focus on the effective length of life of the product and how intensively the product is used during the product life-time (i.e. maximising the number of service units provided by the product).
