# Mitigation Target

The primary goal is for a shift to an effective average level of *healthy diet* (global dietary guidelines for consumption of red meat, sugar, fruits and vegetables, and total energy intake). 

# Mitigation Potential

> Feasible potential 1.7 (1.0–2.7).  Technical potential 3.5 (2.1–5.5).  Estimates reflect direct mitigation from diverted agricultural production only, not including land-use effects.

The total potential for shift to sustainable healthy diets is estimated to be 3.6 (0.3–8.0) Gt CO₂-eq yr–1 and can be broken down into:

- Full value chain: 3.6 (0.3–8.0) Gt CO₂-eq yr–1
	-  $CH_4$ and $N_2O$ only: 2.5 (1.5–3.9) Gt CO₂-eq yr–1
		- Agricultural production only: 1.7 (1–2.7) Gt CO₂-eq yr–1

# Primary Reference

> **Critical assessment and conclusion**. Shifting to sustainable healthy diets has large potential to achieve global GHG mitigation targets as well as public health and environmental benefits (high confidence). Based on studies to date, there is medium confidence that shifting toward sustainable healthy diets has a technical potential including savings in the full value chain of 3.6 (0.3–8.0) Gt CO₂-eq yr–1 of which 2.5 (1.5–3.9) Gt CO₂-eq yr–1 is considered plausible based on a range of GWP100 values for $CH_4$ and $N_2O$. When accounting for diverted agricultural production only, the feasible potential is 1.7 (1–2.7) Gt CO₂-eq yr–1.

Vegan: Completely plant-based [@springmannAnalysisValuationHealth2016;@stehfestClimateBenefitsChanging2009]. 

Vegetarian: Grains, vegetables, fruits, sugars, oils, eggs and dairy, and generally at most one serving per month of meat or seafood [@springmannAnalysisValuationHealth2016;@tilmanGlobalDietsLink2014;@stehfestClimateBenefitsChanging2009].

Flexitarian: 75% of meat and dairy replaced by cereals and pulses; at least 500 g per day fruits and vegetables; at least 100 g per day of plant-based protein sources; modest amounts of animal-based proteins and limited amounts of red meat (one portion per week), refined sugar (less than 5% of total energy), vegetable oils high in saturated fat, and starchy foods with relatively high glycaemic index [@springmannAnalysisValuationHealth2016;@hedenusImportanceReducedMeat2014].

Healthy diet: Based on global dietary guidelines for consumption of red meat, sugar, fruits and vegetables, and total energy intake [@springmannAnalysisValuationHealth2016;@bajzeljImportanceFooddemandManagement2014]. 

Fair and frugal: Global daily per-capita calorie intake of 2800 kcal/cap/day (11.7 MJ/cap/day), paired with relatively low level of animal products [@smithHowMuchLand2013].

Pescetarian: Vegetarian diet that includes seafood [@tilmanGlobalDietsLink2014]. 

Climate carnivore: 75% of ruminant meat and dairy replaced by other meat [@hedenusImportanceReducedMeat2014].

Mediterranean: Vegetables, fruits, grains, sugars, oils, eggs, dairy, seafood, moderate amounts of poultry, pork, lamb and beef [@tilmanGlobalDietsLink2014].
