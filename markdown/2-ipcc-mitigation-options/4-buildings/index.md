<h1 class="cv-h2">M-4 - Buildings</h1>


The buildings sector is a significant source of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, responsible for **19%** of global CO₂-eq emissions. This sector includes both residential and commercial buildings, covering emissions from the construction, operation, and maintenance of these structures. It addresses emissions from direct sources, such as fuel combustion for heating and cooking, and indirect sources, such as electricity consumption for lighting, cooling, and appliances.

As urbanisation continues to accelerate, particularly in developing regions, the challenge of reducing emissions in the buildings sector becomes increasingly critical. Effective mitigation strategies within this sector include enhancing energy efficiency in building design and operation, transitioning to low-carbon energy sources, and adopting sustainable construction practices.

Technological advancements, supported by strong policy frameworks and market incentives, are essential for reducing emissions in the buildings sector. Key strategies include improving insulation, deploying energy-efficient appliances and lighting, and integrating renewable energy systems such as solar panels. Additionally, retrofitting existing buildings and promoting low-carbon building materials can significantly contribute to emissions reduction. However, the successful implementation of these solutions requires careful consideration of regional building practices, economic feasibility, and the need for supportive infrastructure and regulatory standards to achieve substantial, long-term mitigation outcomes in the buildings sector.

TODO:

Chapter 9 of [@ipccar6wg3ClimateChange20222022].

In addition to chapter 9, chapter 5 also contains some building related mitigation options:

- 5.3.1 Efficient Service Provision
	- Shelter (m2)
		- Avoid:
			- Smaller decent dwellings
			- Shared common spaces
			- Multigenerational housing
		- Shift:
			- Less material-intensive dwelling designs
			- Shift from single-family to multi-family dwellings
		- Improve:
			- Use wood as material
			- Use low-carbon production processes for building materials (e.g. cement and steel)
	- Thermal Comfort (indoor temperature)
		- Avoid:
			- Reduce m2 as for Shelter/Avoid
			- Change temperature set-points
			- Change dress code
			- Change working times
		- Shift:
			- Architectural design (shading, natural ventilation, etc)
		- Improve:
			- Solar thermal devices
			- Improved insulation
			- Heat pumps
			- District heating
	- Lighting (lumens)
		- Avoid:
			- Occupancy sensors
			- Lighting controls
		- Shift:
			- Architectural designs with maximal daylighting
		- Improve:
			- LED lamps

Urban mitigation options are categorised into three broad strategies:

1. **Reducing or Changing Urban Energy and Material Use**: This involves sustainable production and consumption across all sectors, supported by spatial planning and infrastructure improvements.
2. **Electrification and Switching to Net-Zero-Emissions Resources**: Emphasises transitioning to renewable energy sources and increasing the electrification of urban systems.
3. **Enhancing Carbon Storage**: Utilises urban green and blue infrastructure to store carbon, providing multiple co-benefits.

A fourth aspect, socio-behavioural changes, can shift energy demand and result from implementing these strategies. Urban areas, viewed as interconnected systems, can leverage integrated mitigation options to create cascading effects across transport, energy, buildings, land use, and behaviour, achieving systemic transformation.

Mitigation actions occur at various urban scales, from households to city regions, and can be standalone or system-wide. Effective urban mitigation policies often involve multiple integrated interventions, providing greater emissions savings than individual actions.

Integrated urban actions not only reduce emissions but also enhance human well-being and support broader sustainability goals. Cities, due to their complex interactions and alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), are crucial for harnessing synergies and co-benefits to achieve comprehensive emissions reductions.




Chapter 8 of [@ipccar6wg3ClimateChange20222022] outlines 9 mitigation options for urban systems.

# Emissions

We estimate that the buildings sector was accountable for 18.7% of global greenhouse gas emissions for 2020 (8,870 MtCO₂-eq, see [GHG Emissions](/5-resources/4-reference/3-ghg-emissions.md)).
