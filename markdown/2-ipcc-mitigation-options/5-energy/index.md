<h1 class="cv-h2">M-5 - Energy</h1>


The energy sector, after reallocating indirect emissions from electricity and heat generation to other sectors, is directly responsible for **13%** of global CO₂-eq emissions. This sector encompasses the supply, transformation, transmission, and storage of energy, focusing on the processes that produce and deliver energy from various sources, including fossil fuels, renewables, and nuclear power. It addresses emissions from direct sources, such as fuel combustion in power plants and refineries, and the inefficiencies in energy transformation and transmission systems.

As global energy demand continues to rise, particularly in developing regions, mitigating emissions within the energy sector is crucial for addressing climate change. Effective mitigation strategies in this sector include transitioning to low-carbon energy sources, improving the efficiency of energy generation and transmission, and deploying carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) technologies.

Technological innovations, combined with policy interventions and market mechanisms, are central to reducing emissions in the energy sector. The rapid deployment of renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and hydropower, is critical for decarbonising energy supply. Additionally, enhancing the efficiency of energy transformation and transmission processes can significantly reduce emissions. The phasing out of coal and the transition to cleaner fuels, such as natural gas and hydrogen, are also important pathways. However, implementing these solutions requires careful consideration of energy security, economic viability, and the development of infrastructure and regulatory frameworks to ensure a just and sustainable transition to a low-carbon energy system.


# Mitigation Potential
TBD.


# Mitigation Options
TBD.

# Emissions
We estimate that the energy sector was accountable for 13.4% of global greenhouse gas emissions for 2020 (6,363 MtCO₂-eq, see [GHG Emissions](/5-resources/4-reference/3-ghg-emissions.md)).

See [E-1 - Energy](/2-ipcc-mitigation-options/ipcc-2019-emissions/1-energy/index.md) for a summary of IPCC guidelines for emission reporting.
