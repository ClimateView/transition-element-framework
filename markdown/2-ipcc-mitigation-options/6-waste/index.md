<h1 class="cv-h2">M-6 - Waste</h1>


The waste sector, while a smaller contributor at **3%** of of global CO₂-eq emissions, still plays a significant role in climate change, particularly through methane (CH₄) emissions. This sector encompasses the collection, treatment, and disposal of solid waste and wastewater, including activities such as landfilling, composting, incineration, and recycling. It addresses emissions from both the decomposition of organic waste and the energy used in waste processing and management.

As urban populations grow and consumption patterns change, particularly in developing regions, the challenge of mitigating emissions in the waste sector becomes increasingly important. Effective mitigation strategies within this sector include reducing waste generation, enhancing recycling and resource recovery, improving waste treatment technologies, and capturing and utilising methane emissions from landfills and wastewater treatment plants.

Technological advancements, coupled with policy support and public engagement, are crucial for reducing emissions in the waste sector. Strategies such as improving waste separation, increasing the efficiency of recycling processes, and implementing advanced waste-to-energy technologies can significantly lower emissions. Additionally, capturing methane from landfills and wastewater treatment facilities for energy use represents a key opportunity for mitigation. However, the successful implementation of these strategies requires consideration of regional waste management practices, economic feasibility, and the development of infrastructure and regulatory frameworks to achieve meaningful, long-term reductions in waste sector emissions.

TODO:

Chapter 12, Cross-sectoral Perspectives, the Sixth Assessment Report ipccar6wg3ClimateChange20222022 provides an integrated analysis of mitigation options across different sectors. This chapter emphasises the interconnections and synergies between sectors, highlighting how coordinated strategies can enhance the effectiveness of climate change mitigation efforts.

Key Points:

- **Holistic Approach**: The chapter underscores the importance of a comprehensive approach, considering the cumulative impacts of sector-specific actions.
- **Synergies and Trade-offs**: It identifies potential synergies and trade-offs between mitigation actions in various sectors, such as energy, transport, agriculture, and industry.
- **Systemic Transformation**: Emphasis is placed on the need for systemic transformation to achieve deep decarbonisation and sustainable development goals.
- **Policy Integration**: The chapter advocates for integrated policies that align sectoral actions with broader climate objectives, promoting coherence and efficiency.
- **Innovation and Technology**: It discusses the role of technological innovation and cross-sectoral cooperation in driving effective mitigation strategies.

This chapter is pivotal for understanding how integrated, cross-sectoral strategies can contribute to more robust and resilient climate action plans.

# Emissions
We estimate that the waste sector was accountable for 3.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions for 2020 (1,651 MtCO₂-eq, see [GHG Emissions](/5-resources/4-reference/3-ghg-emissions.md)).

See [E-4 - Waste](/2-ipcc-mitigation-options/ipcc-2019-emissions/4-waste/index.md) for a summary of IPCC guidelines for emission reporting.
