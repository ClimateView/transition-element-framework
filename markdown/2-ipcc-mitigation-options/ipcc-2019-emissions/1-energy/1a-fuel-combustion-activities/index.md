# [E-1A1 - Energy Industries](/2-ipcc-mitigation-options/ipcc-2019-emissions/1-energy/1a-fuel-combustion-activities/1a1-energy-industries/index.md)

Emissions from the production of energy, primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels in power plants, refineries, and other energy production facilities. It encompasses electricity generation, heat production, and other energy-related services. Key emissions include carbon dioxide ($\ce{CO2}$), methane ($\ce{CH4}$), and nitrous oxide ($\ce{N2O}$).


# [E-1A2 - Manufacturing Industries and Construction](/2-ipcc-mitigation-options/ipcc-2019-emissions/1-energy/1a-fuel-combustion-activities/1a2-manufacturing-industries-construction/index.md)

Emissions from fuel combustion in the manufacturing and construction sectors. This includes energy used for processes in industries such as steel, cement, chemical production, and various manufacturing operations. Emissions arise from the direct combustion of fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas for heat and power in industrial processes.

# [E-1A3 - Transport](/2-ipcc-mitigation-options/ipcc-2019-emissions/1-energy/1a-fuel-combustion-activities/1a3-transport/index.md)

Emissions from the combustion of fuels in all modes of transportation. This includes road transport (cars, trucks, buses), aviation, railways, and shipping. The primary emissions are from the burning of petrol, diesel, jet fuel, and other transportation fuels, resulting in carbon dioxide ($\ce{CO2}$), methane ($\ce{CH4}$), and nitrous oxide ($\ce{N2O}$).

# [E-1A4 - Other sectors](/2-ipcc-mitigation-options/ipcc-2019-emissions/1-energy/1a-fuel-combustion-activities/1a4-other-sectors/index.md)

Emissions from fuel combustion in residential, commercial, and institutional buildings, as well as agriculture, forestry, and fishing activities. This sub-sector covers the use of fuels for heating, cooking, and other energy needs in these non-industrial sectors. Key emissions sources are residential heating systems, commercial boilers, and equipment used in agriculture and forestry.

# [E-1A5 - Non-specified Fuel Combustion Activities](/2-ipcc-mitigation-options/ipcc-2019-emissions/1-energy/1a-fuel-combustion-activities/1a5-non-specified/index.md)

Emissions from fuel combustion activities that do not fall into the other specified categories. This could include miscellaneous energy use in various sectors not explicitly covered, such as specific fuel uses in military operations or other specialised applications. The emissions profile depends on the specific activities but generally includes carbon dioxide ($\ce{CO2}$), methane ($\ce{CH4}$), and nitrous oxide ($\ce{N2O}$).
