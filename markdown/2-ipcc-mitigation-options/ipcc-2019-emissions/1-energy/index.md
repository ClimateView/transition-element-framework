<h1 class="cv-h2">E-1 - Energy</h1>



The energy sector, pivotal to modern economies, is largely dependent on burning fossil fuels like oil, coal, and gas. This process converts the carbon and hydrogen in these fuels into carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O), simultaneously releasing energy. This energy is either used directly to heat spaces and fluids or converted—though with some loss—into mechanical energy. This mechanical energy is crucial for generating electricity and powering vehicles.

In terms of environmental impact, the energy sector is often the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in developed countries, accounting for more than 90% of CO₂ emissions and about 75% of all greenhouse gases emitted. Within these figures, CO₂ forms the vast majority (around 95%) of emissions from this sector, with the remaining comprised of methane and nitrous oxide.

The major sources of these emissions vary; about 70% come from stationary sources, which include power plants and refineries that are fixed in one spot. The remaining emissions arise from mobile sources like cars and trucks, contributing to approximately a quarter of the sector’s emissions. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for tackling climate change and designing effective mitigation strategies.

## [E-1A - Fuel Combustion Activities](/2-ipcc-mitigation-options/ipcc-2019-emissions/1-energy/1a-fuel-combustion-activities/index.md)

Emissions resulting from the burning of fuels for energy production. This includes all combustion-related activities across various sectors such as electricity and heat production, transportation, manufacturing industries, and residential heating. Key emissions from this category are carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O).

## [E-1B - Fugitive Emissions from Fuels](/2-ipcc-mitigation-options/ipcc-2019-emissions/1-energy/1b-fugitive-emissions-from-fuels/index.md)

Emissions that occur during the extraction, processing, and distribution of fossil fuels. These emissions are not the result of fuel combustion but rather leakage and accidental releases. This category includes emissions from coal mining, oil and natural gas extraction, refining, and the transportation of fossil fuels. Methane is a significant component of fugitive emissions due to its potent greenhouse gas effect.

## [E-1C - Carbon Dioxide Transport and Storage](/2-ipcc-mitigation-options/ipcc-2019-emissions/1-energy/1c-carbon-dioxide-transport-storage/index.md)

Emissions and potential leaks associated with the transportation and storage of CO₂. This category covers activities related to the capture of CO₂ from industrial processes or power plants, its transportation (via pipelines, ships, or other means), and its injection into geological formations for long-term storage (known as Carbon Capture and Storage, CCS). The primary concern here is ensuring that CO₂ remains contained and does not leak back into the atmosphere.
