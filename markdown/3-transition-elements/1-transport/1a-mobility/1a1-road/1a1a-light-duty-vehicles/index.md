# Transition Elements



Key transition elements include the shift to electric and hydrogen vehicles, promoting eco-driving practices, and improving vehicle technology for greater efficiency.  Additionally, strategies like remote working, non-travel meetings, and increasing the renewable proportion in petrol aim to further reduce the environmental impact of light-duty vehicles. Collectively, these initiatives work towards significantly lowering emissions and advancing sustainable mobility within the subsector.
