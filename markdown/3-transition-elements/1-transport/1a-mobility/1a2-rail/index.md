Passenger rail transport is a key component of sustainable personal mobility. To further reduce emissions in this sector, three primary strategies are explored: the use of biofuels as a cleaner alternative for diesel-powered trains, the transition to electric passenger rail, and the adoption of hydrogen-powered trains.
