This subsector focuses on air travel, including domestic and international flights that transport people across various distances. This subsector is a critical component of global connectivity but also a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions.

# Transition Elements

To mitigate its environmental impact, the table below examines four Transition Elements: the adoption of biofuels as a sustainable alternative to conventional jet fuel, the development of more efficient passenger airplanes to reduce fuel consumption, the exploration of electric passenger airplanes for short-haul flights, and promoting a shift from air travel to rail transport where feasible. These strategies collectively aim to reduce the carbon footprint of passenger aviation and contribute to the sector's sustainability.
