This subsector focuses on the movement of people via water, including services such as ferries, cruise ships, and other vessels dedicated to passenger travel. It plays a vital role in connecting regions, particularly where water routes provide more efficient or necessary alternatives to land or air transport, covering both domestic and international journeys from short-distance ferries to long-haul cruises. As a significant source of emissions, passenger waterborne transport is a key area for climate mitigation.

# Transition Elements

The table below explores the Transition Elements for reducing emissions in sea passenger transport: transitioning to LNG as a marine fuel, enhancing operational efficiency, adopting biofuels in both LNG-powered and conventional vessels, and electrifying domestic sea passenger transport. Together, these options provide a comprehensive approach to decarbonising waterborne transport and advancing sustainability in the sector.
