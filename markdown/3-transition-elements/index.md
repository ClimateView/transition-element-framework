The **Transition Elements** catalogue is a dynamic and evolving catalogue that provides computational models tailored to each climate mitigation option outlined in the [Mitigation Compendium](/2-ipcc-mitigation-options/index.md). These models are designed to facilitate detailed analysis, enabling stakeholders to simulate and assess the effectiveness of various strategies in real-world scenarios. As we continue to expand and refine this catalogue, it serves as a critical tool for translating high-level mitigation concepts into actionable pathways for climate action.
