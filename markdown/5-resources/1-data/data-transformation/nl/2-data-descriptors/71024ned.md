# Details

## Short Description

This table contains information about the length of the Dutch railways, classified by track gauge (number of tracks) and the presence of electrification. It covers all railways in use for passenger and/or freight transport managed by ProRail, provided they are connected to the main railway network managed by ProRail.

Railways that are privately managed (including tracks managed by service provider Strukton Rail Short Line) are excluded in this publication. This applies, for example, to railways in industrial areas managed by companies, but also to railway lines used solely for tourist purposes. Narrow gauge, tram, and metro lines are also excluded.

Data available from: 2005.

Status of the figures: 
Final. The data for the years 2005 to 2017 are comparable to each other and also temporally comparable with figures from before 2005.

In the figures for 2013, the railway of the Hanzelijn, which has been in use since December 2012, is not yet included. In the regions of the Netherlands, total, Eastern Netherlands, Flevoland, and Overijssel, the length of railways is therefore too low for 2013.

Changes as of November 2023:
The reference year 2023 has been added. Some electrification adjustments have been implemented. As a result, there are differences in 2023 compared to previous years in the provinces of Limburg and South Holland.

When will new figures be released:
The figures for the year 2024 will be published in the third quarter of 2024.
