### Household Waste per Municipality per Inhabitant (2021)

This table shows the amounts of collected household waste per municipality. The quantity of household waste per resident can vary greatly by municipality. There are several reasons for this. For instance, in a municipality with many high-rise buildings, there will be less organic waste and bulky garden waste because there are fewer gardens. Municipalities with a pay-as-you-throw system, where households pay more if they dispose of more waste, often generate less waste per resident. Tourist municipalities often collect more waste. This is particularly noticeable on the Wadden Islands where relatively more waste per resident is generated.

The data concern the amounts as collected. More and more municipalities are separating out recyclable materials from their mixed (bulky) residual waste after collection. The only quantity that does not pertain to collected waste is the end-processed waste. For a definition of end-processed waste, see: definitions and symbols explanations.

Municipalities that jointly operate a recycling center allocate the waste streams to the participating municipalities based on the number of inhabitants. The Zeeland Cleaning Service up until now allocated the quantities for the Zeeland municipalities based on the weighted kilos per recycling center, but has now also switched to allocation based on the number of inhabitants. This results in a break in 2021 with previous years for the figures in the collection system for Zeeland municipalities.

The municipality of Amsterdam reported the total bulky waste in the collection system until 2020. Besides bulk municipal residual waste, the total bulky waste also includes separated flows of bulky waste such as wood waste and clean rubble delivered through the recycling center. Because these flows were also included separately in the figures, there was double counting until 2020. The municipality of Amsterdam has provided the actual amounts of bulky household waste for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. These have been processed in the figures. However, this creates a break with the figures from 2018 and earlier. The figures for 2018 and earlier will be adjusted once the correct amounts of bulky household waste for these years are known.

In 2022, the municipality of Weesp was reclassified and joined with Amsterdam on March 1st. The waste from Weesp is accounted for in Amsterdam, and the municipality is not listed separately in the table.

Data available from: 2001
