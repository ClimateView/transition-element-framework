### Description

This table contains key figures on the number of active passenger cars with a Dutch license plate, broken down by vehicle characteristics (year of manufacture, type of fuel, weight, and color) by registration of the owner and characteristics of the owner (province and age). The figures are based on information from the Basic Vehicle Registration (BRV), also known as the RDW license plate registration. This registration allows for counts of registered Dutch vehicles on January 1, which were allowed to participate in road traffic in the previous year.
Vehicles that have not been insured for the entire previous year and thus were not allowed to drive are excluded. Vehicles that are in the company stock on January 1 are also not included.

Data available from: 2019

Status of the figures:
The figures in this table are definitive.

Changes as of August 30, 2024:
CBS has recently received a new variable from RDW that better indicates whether a hybrid vehicle is an HEV or a PHEV. An HEV (hybrid electric) is a vehicle with a combustion engine supported by an electric motor. The vehicle does not have a plug and cannot be externally charged. A PHEV (plug-in hybrid) is an electric vehicle that combines an electric motor with a combustion engine. The vehicle's battery can be charged with a plug at an external charging point. The arrival of the new variable revealed that for a portion of the hybrid vehicles, the second fuel type (electric) was missing in the RDW register, which led to this group of vehicles being incorrectly excluded from the electric vehicles category. Due to this correction, about 4,000 vehicles in 2023 and 3,000 vehicles in 2024 receive a different main fuel type. As a result, the number of electric vehicles in the motor vehicle fleet (passenger cars and vans) increases and the number of vehicles with other fuel types decreases in equal numbers.

When will new figures be available?
Figures on the Dutch fleet of passenger cars on January 1 will be published at the end of the first quarter of the reporting year.
