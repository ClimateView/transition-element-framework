### Overview of Vehicle Performance Data - CBS

This table contains figures on traffic performance (vehicle kilometers) of passenger cars, delivery vans, trucks, tractors for semi-trailers, special vehicles, and buses. Vehicle kilometers of Dutch vehicles are broken down into Dutch vehicles on Dutch territory and Dutch vehicles on foreign territory. In addition, there are figures of the total distance traveled on Dutch territory, with a distinction made between kilometers traveled by Dutch and foreign vehicles.

The vehicle population for which kilometers are estimated is based on the motor vehicle fleet statistics. The figures in this table are based on the new selection method of the motor vehicle fleet. The difference between the old and new selection method is described in a methodology report, see point 4. The series of kilometers estimated based on the new population is available from the reporting year 2018. The series based on the old vehicle population runs up to and including the reporting year 2020. The method of estimating the kilometers has not changed, only the population.

For the figures of the reporting year 2020, the 'smoothing effect' of the method was corrected by means of a correction factor. This effect smooths out the annual variation in the figures. This gives a distorted picture of periods in which mobility suddenly changes drastically, such as in 2020 due to the corona crisis.

Data available from: 2018

Status of the figures:
The figures up to and including 2021 are final, and the figures for 2022 and 2023 have a provisional status.

Changes as of October 21, 2024:
The figures for 2023 have been added.

When will new figures be available?
The new figures are expected at the end of 2025.
