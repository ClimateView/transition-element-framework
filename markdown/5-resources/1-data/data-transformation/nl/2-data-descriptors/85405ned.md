### ShortDescription (Translated)
This table contains figures on the traffic performance (vehicle kilometers) of Dutch passenger cars, broken down by type of fuel and age of the vehicle. The table also includes the total number of vehicle kilometers driven by all passenger cars and an average per vehicle.
The table also contains the number of passenger cars in use, this is not a figure but the number of vehicles that could have been on the road during the reporting year. This concerns active vehicles, vehicles that have been taken off the road (due to, for example, export or scrapping), and vehicles that have been in the company stock.
The vehicle population for which kilometers are estimated is based on the statistics on vehicle stock. The population of the figures in this table is based on the new selection method of the vehicle stock. The difference between the old and new selection method is described in a methodology report, see paragraph 4. The series of kilometers estimated based on the new population are available from the reporting year 2018. The series based on the old vehicle population runs up to and including the 2020 reporting year. The way the kilometers are estimated has not changed, only the population.

For the figures of the reporting year 2020, the 'smoothing effect' of the method was corrected using a correction factor. This smoothing effect flattens the annual variation in the figures. This gives a distorted picture of periods when mobility suddenly changes drastically, such as in 2020 due to the corona crisis.

Data available from: 2018

Status of the figures:
The figures in this table for 2018 to 2022 are final and those for 2023 are provisional.
