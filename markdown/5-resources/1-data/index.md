This section houses data and data transformation descriptors for estimating the parameters required in the Transition Elements.

Each **data descriptor** describes a single table of data that belongs to a data repository. Each **transformation descriptor** describes one of more methods for estimating the value of a parameter or indicator using one or more data descriptors. The relationship of each of these is highlighted in the diagram below.

# [Data Transformation](data-transformation/index.md)


The data descriptors and transformation descriptors in the Transition Element Framework are organised by region in the [Data Transformations](data-transformation/index.md) section. 

# [Data Definitions](definitions/index.md)

The data definitions section contains the complete list of parameters used by the Transition Element models, as well as common default values for those parameters.
