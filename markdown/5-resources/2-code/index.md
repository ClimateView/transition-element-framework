# Open-source resources

The Transition Element Framework (TEF) is built entirely with open-source tools. Alongside this website, we share the full source code, model files, and supporting scripts openly on GitHub. This includes the macros, generation code, and documentation that make up the framework.

You can explore the repository here:
