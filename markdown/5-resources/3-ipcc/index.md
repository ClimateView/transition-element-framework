# Introduction

The IPCC was established in 1988 by [World Meteorological Organization](https://wmo.int/) (WMO) and the [United Nations Environment Programme](https://www.unep.org/) (UNEP) and was endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly in 1990.  

# Working Groups

The IPCC is structured into three working groups and one task force, each with a specific focus area:

- **Working Group I (WG1): The Physical Science Basis**  
  Examines the physical science underpinning past, present, and future climate change.
- **Working Group II (WG2): Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability**  
  Deals with impacts of climate change on ecosystems, biodiversity, and human communities at various levels and sectors, and the options for adaptation.
- **Working Group III (WG3): Mitigation of Climate Change**  
  Focuses on methods for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.
- **Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (TFI)**  
  Develops methodologies and practices for measuring and reporting on emissions and removals of greenhouse gases.
