[**Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis**](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/){target="_blank"}  [@ipccar6wg1ClimateChange20212021]  is the first instalment of the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report, released in August 2021. This publication, prepared by Working Group I, provides the most current and comprehensive assessment of the physical science of climate change. 

It underscores the unequivocal influence of human activities on the Earth's climate system, noting that global warming has reached approximately 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels. The report highlights the critical need for immediate, rapid, and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to limit global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C. 

By detailing the latest advancements in climate science, the report serves as an essential scientific foundation for global climate policy, aiming to guide governments and stakeholders in taking effective action to mitigate the impacts of climate change.
