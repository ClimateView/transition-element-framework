[**Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability**](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/){target="_blank"}   [@ipccar6wg2ClimateChange20222022], published in February 2022 as part of the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report cycle, focuses on the global consequences of climate change. This second instalment, developed by Working Group II, delves into the effects of climate change on natural and human systems, examining both the observed impacts and projected risks across various regions and sectors. 

The report emphasizes the increasing vulnerability of ecosystems and human communities, particularly in lower-income areas, highlighting the disparities in exposure and adaptive capacity worldwide. It underscores the urgency of integrating adaptation measures into development strategies to reduce vulnerability and exposure to climate change. 

Additionally, the report stresses the importance of immediate and coordinated action to address and manage the unavoidable impacts of climate change, reinforcing the need for global cooperation in building resilience and reducing long-term risks.
