[**Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change**](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/){target="_blank"}  [@ipccar6wg3ClimateChange20222022], the third part of the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report, was released in April 2022 by Working Group III. 

This report explores the options and strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change. It assesses the current state of global greenhouse gas emissions and examines various mitigation pathways and strategies across key sectors such as energy, transport, buildings, and agriculture. 

The report emphasises the critical window of opportunity that still exists to achieve the significant emissions reductions required to keep global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C above pre-industrial levels but notes that this window is rapidly closing. Highlighting the interconnections between mitigation actions and sustainable development goals, the report calls for immediate and ambitious global efforts to reduce emissions, alongside enhancing societal and ecosystem resilience to climate change impacts.
