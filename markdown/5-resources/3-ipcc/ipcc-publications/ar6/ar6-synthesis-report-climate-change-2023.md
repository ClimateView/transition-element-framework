[**AR6 Synthesis Report: Climate Change 2023**](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-cycle/){target="_blank"}  [@ipccar6syrClimateChange20232023] is the concluding instalment of the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report, integrating insights from the three Working Group reports and special reports published during the AR6 cycle. 

This synthesis provides a comprehensive overview of the state of knowledge on climate change, its impacts, and future risks, as well as strategies for mitigation and adaptation. Released in 2023, it underscores the urgent need for global cooperation and immediate action across all sectors to limit global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C above pre-industrial levels. 

The report highlights the interconnectedness of climate action with broader societal goals, emphasising that effective climate policies can also advance health, equity, and sustainable development worldwide. Serving as a critical resource for policymakers, the Synthesis Report aims to inform international climate negotiations and guide the global response to the climate crisis.
