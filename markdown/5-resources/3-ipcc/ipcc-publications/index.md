title: IPCC Publications
---


Since its establishment in 1988, the IPCC has released a wide range of reports that provide the scientific foundation for global climate policy. These publications, grouped by cycle period, offer the latest insights into climate science, its impacts, and strategies for mitigation and adaptation. Presented here in order of newest to oldest, the reports cover various topics essential for understanding and addressing climate change, from comprehensive assessments to specific methodology guidelines.

# Report Types
There are four major report types published during each cycle period.

## Methodology Report (MR)
Methodology Reports provide scientific and technical guidelines for countries on how to estimate and report their greenhouse gas emissions and removals. These reports are crucial for ensuring consistency, transparency, and comparability in emissions data used to assess progress under international agreements like the Paris Agreement.


## Assessment Report (AR)
The Assessment Reports are the most comprehensive and authoritative publications of the IPCC. They provide a state-of-the-art understanding of climate change, including its impacts, future risks, and mitigation and adaptation strategies. These reports are divided into contributions from the three Working Groups, each focusing on a different aspect: physical science, impacts and adaptation, and mitigation.

## Synthesis Report (SYR)
The Synthesis Report integrates findings from the three Working Group contributions of the Assessment Report, as well as relevant Special Reports. It provides a concise and accessible overview of the most relevant scientific information on climate change, aimed at policymakers and decision-makers, with a clear focus on policy implications and recommendations.

## Special Report (SR)
Special Reports focus on specific topics that require urgent attention or deeper analysis. These reports are typically requested by governments and policymakers to explore the implications of climate science on particular sectors or regions. Examples include reports on global warming of 1.5°C, climate change and land, and oceans and the cryosphere.



# Sixth assessment cycle 


## 2014-2023

The **Sixth Assessment Report (AR6)** cycle emphasises the critical need for immediate and ambitious actions to limit global warming, through its comprehensive evaluation across three Working Group reports and a Synthesis Report. It details the physical science basis of climate change, impacts and adaptation strategies, and mitigation pathways.

# Fifth assessment cycle 

## 2007-2014

The IPCC's **Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)**, initiated after two years of scoping and preparatory work, began in earnest with Lead Author meetings and discussions on cross-cutting issues. AR5, advancing beyond its predecessors, focuses significantly on the socio-economic dimensions of climate change and its implications for sustainable development, risk management, and response strategies through both adaptation and mitigation. 

The report aims to provide nuanced, region-specific information, including detailed analyses of phenomena like monsoons and El Niño. It also emphasises the integration of various topics such as the water cycle, the Earth's carbon cycle, ice sheets, and sea-level rise in a cross-cutting approach. Further, AR5 enhances its examination of uncertainties and risks, incorporates economic analyses, and introduces new scenarios, ensuring a comprehensive and integrated approach to understanding and addressing climate change.

# Fourth assessment cycle 

## 2001-2007


The IPCC's **Fourth Assessment Report (AR4)**, released in 2007, marked significant advancements in the understanding of climate change. 


- Working Group I delivered new insights into both human and natural climate drivers, provided a comprehensive review of past climate changes, and presented stronger evidence linking recent climate changes to human activities, including continent-specific assessments. 
- Working Group II evaluated the observed impacts of climate changes, identifying particularly vulnerable regions and communities, and projected future impacts in the context of varying development paths and multiple stressors. 
- Working Group III assessed trends in emissions, explored mitigation strategies and pathways towards stabilising atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, and examined the costs associated with these strategies. 


AR4 also emphasised the integration of climate change mitigation with sustainable development policies, the interconnections between mitigation and adaptation, and provided a detailed evaluation of uncertainties and risks. The findings of AR4 played a pivotal role at the Thirteenth Conference of the Parties (COP-13) in 2007, which adopted the Bali Action Plan. This plan recognized the urgent need for deep cuts in global emissions, spurred by the unequivocal evidence of climate warming and its potential severe impacts as highlighted by AR4, leading to a call for long-term cooperative action to implement the UNFCCC effectively.

# Third assessment cycle 

## 1995-2001

The IPCC's **Third Assessment Report (TAR)**, initiated in 1997 and completed in 2001, advanced the understanding of climate dynamics, human influence on the current climate, and future climate projections through enhanced modelling and new scenarios. 

- Working Group I detailed climate processes and feedback mechanisms.
- Working Group II focused on updating information about impacts, vulnerabilities, and sustainable development adaptations. 
- Working Group III evaluated mitigation strategies, analyzing their costs, co-benefits, and the interplay with sustainable development, addressing barriers and policy solutions. 

At the 2002 Eighth Conference of the Parties (COP-8), the findings of the TAR were acknowledged with concern, highlighting the need for substantial global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to achieve the objectives of the UNFCCC.

# Second assessment cycle

## 1990-1995

Following the first assessment cycle, the IPCC produced supplementary and special reports in 1992 and 1994 to support the negotiation processes, offering updates on radiative forcing, emission scenarios, and guidelines for assessing impacts and greenhouse gas inventories.

In 1995, the IPCC released its **Second Assessment Report (SAR)**, following a decision in 1991 to expand its membership to include all WMO and UNEP member countries and improve participation from developing nations. This report featured enhanced leadership diversity, with each working group co-chaired by representatives from both developed and developing countries. 


- Working Group I noted significant advancements in climate change understanding since 1990. 
- Working Group II expanded its focus to assess the feasibility of adaptation and mitigation strategies.
- Working Group III introduced analyses of the social and economic dimensions of climate change. 

 
The SAR was instrumental in shaping the UNFCCC's development, particularly influencing the negotiations of the Kyoto Protocol, and was recognised at the 1996 Second Conference of the Parties (COP-2) as the most comprehensive and authoritative climate change assessment available at the time.

# First assessment cycle 
## 1988-1990

In 1990, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) delivered its **First Assessment Report (FAR)**, which led the United Nations General Assembly to begin negotiations for a climate change framework. This report, finalised on August 30, 1990, in Sundsvall, Sweden, informed the decision to create an effective convention on climate change by the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development.
