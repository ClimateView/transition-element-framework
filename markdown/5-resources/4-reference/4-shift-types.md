title: Shift Types
---


Central to the TEF is a robust Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive (MECE) categori- zation, clearly defining each Activity Shift within exactly one of six categories.


# Type Shift 
Substituting one activity entirely with another (e.g., private cars → public transit).

# Resource Shift 
Substituting energy or material inputs (e.g., fossil fuels → renewable electricity).

# Utilisation Shift
Reducing the frequency or intensity of activities (e.g., fewer or shared trips).

# Work Efficiency Shift
Improving the efficiency of converting inputs into outcomes (e.g., better insulation).

# Resource Efficiency Shift 
Reducing resources per unit of outcome (e.g., higher fuel efficiency).

# Carbon Shift
Enhancing sequestration or carbon capture (e.g., reforestation, carbon storage).
