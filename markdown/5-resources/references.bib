Rising incomes and urbanization are driving a global dietary transition in which traditional diets are replaced by diets higher in refined sugars, refined fats, oils and meats. By 2050 these dietary trends, if unchecked, would be a major contributor to an estimated 80 per cent increase in global agricultural greenhouse gas emissions from food production and to global land clearing. Moreover, these dietary shifts are greatly increasing the incidence of type {II} diabetes, coronary heart disease and other chronic non-communicable diseases that lower global life expectancies. Alternative diets that offer substantial health benefits could, if widely adopted, reduce global agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, reduce land clearing and resultant species extinctions, and help prevent such diet-related chronic non-communicable diseases. The implementation of dietary solutions to the tightly linked diet–environment–health trilemma is a global challenge, and opportunity, of great environmental and public health importance.},

	abstract = {What we eat greatly influences our personal health and the environment we all share. Recent analyses have highlighted the likely dual health and environmental benefits of reducing the fraction of animal-sourced foods in our diets. Here, we couple for the first time, to our knowledge, a region-specific global health model based on dietary and weight-related risk factors with emissions accounting and economic valuation modules to quantify the linked health and environmental consequences of dietary changes. We find that the impacts of dietary changes toward less meat and more plant-based diets vary greatly among regions. The largest absolute environmental and health benefits result from diet shifts in developing countries whereas Western high-income and middle-income countries gain most in per capita terms. Transitioning toward more plant-based diets that are in line with standard dietary guidelines could reduce global mortality by 6–10\% and food-related greenhouse gas emissions by 29–70\% compared with a reference scenario in 2050. We find that the monetized value of the improvements in health would be comparable with, or exceed, the value of the environmental benefits although the exact valuation method used considerably affects the estimated amounts. Overall, we estimate the economic benefits of improving diets to be 1–31 trillion {US} dollars, which is equivalent to 0.4–13\% of global gross domestic product ({GDP}) in 2050. However, significant changes in the global food system would be necessary for regional diets to match the dietary patterns studied here.},

	doi = {10.1111/gcb.12160},
	abstract = {Feeding nine to ten billion people by 2050 and preventing dangerous climate change are two of the greatest challenges facing humanity. Both challenges must be met whilst reducing the impact of land management on ecosystem services that deliver vital goods and services, and support human health and well-being. Few studies to date have considered the interactions between these challenges. In this study we briefly, outline the challenges, review the supply- and demand-side climate mitigation potential available in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use ({AFLOU}) sector, and options for delivering food security. We briefly outline some of the synergies and trade-offs afforded by mitigation practices, before presenting an assessment of the mitigation potential possible in the {AFOLU} sector under possible future scenarios in which demand-side measures co-delivery to aid food security. We conclude that whilst supply-side mitigation measures, such as changes in land management, might either enhance or negatively impact food security, demand-side mitigation measures, such as reduced waste or demand for livestock products, should benefit both food security and greenhouse gas ({GHG}) mitigation. Demand-side measures offer a greater potential (1.5-15.6 Gt {CO}2 -eq. yr(-1) ) in meeting both challenges than do supply-side measures (1.5-4.3 Gt {CO}2 -eq. yr(-1) at carbon prices between 20 and 100 {US}\$ {tCO}2 -eq.(-1) ), but given the enormity of challenges, all options need to be considered. Supply-side measures should be implemented immediately, focussing on those that allow the production of more agricultural product per unit of input. For demand-side measures, given the difficulties in their implementation and lag in their effectiveness, policy should be introduced quickly, and should aim to co-deliver to other policy agendas, such as improving environmental quality, or improving dietary health. These problems facing humanity in the 21(st) Century are extremely challenging, and policy that addresses multiple objectives is required now more than ever. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

A global urbanization wedge, corresponding in particular to energy-efficient urbanization in Asia, might reduce urban energy use by more than 25\%, compared with a business-as-usual scenario.},

But a closer look indicates that different schools of thought suggest possible pathways diverging in their fine structure. This perspective reveals how three different scientific communities — integrated assessment modelers, transport-sector modelers, and place-based modelers — emphasize distinct solution domains. While integrated assessment models focus on fuel composition, transport-sector models put slightly higher emphasis on efficiency measures; in turn place-based research specifies idiosyncratic behavioral and infrastructural mitigation options that are likely to be beneficial in realizing local co-benefits. These specific local approaches could mitigate urban transport emissions by 20–50\%, higher than that revealed in aggregate global models. We discuss differences in approach, possibilities for reconciliation, and the implications of normative assumptions. Targeted three-directional interactions would foster comprehensive understanding of possible low-carbon transportation futures.},

	abstract = {The assessment literature on climate change solutions to date has emphasized technologies and options based on cost-effectiveness analysis. However, many solutions to climate change mitigation misalign with such analytical frameworks. Here, we examine demand-side solutions, a crucial class of mitigation options that go beyond technological specification and cost-benefit analysis. To do so, we synthesize such demand-side mitigation options in the urban, building, transport, and agricultural sectors. We also highlight the specific nature of demand-side solutions in the context of development. We then discuss key analytical considerations to integrate demandside options into overarching assessments on mitigation. Such a framework would include infrastructure solutions that interact with endogenous preference formation. Both hard infrastructures, such as the built environment, and soft infrastructures, such as habits and norms, shape behavior and as a consequence offer significant potential for reducing overall energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. We conclude that systemic infrastructural and behavioral change will likely be a necessary component of a transition to a low-carbon society.

	doi = {10.1016/j.trd.2016.05.008},
	abstract = {This paper investigates the evolution of urban cycling in Montreal, Canada and its link to both built environment indicators and bicycle infrastructure accessibility. The effect of new cycling infrastructure on transport-related greenhouse gas ({GHG}) emissions is then explored. More specifically, we aim at investigating how commuting cycling modal share has evolved across neighborhood built-environment typologies and over time in Montreal, Canada. For this purpose, automobile and bicycle trip information from origin–destination surveys for the years 1998, 2003 and 2008 are used. Neighborhood typologies are generated from different built environment indicators (population and employment density, land use diversity, etc.). Furthermore, to represent the commuter mode choice (bicycle vs automobile), a standard binary logit and simultaneous equation modeling approach are adopted to represent the mode choice and the household location. Among other things, we observe an important increase in the likelihood to cycle across built environment types and over time in the study region. In particular, urban and urban-suburb neighborhoods have experienced an important growth over the 10 years, going from a modal split of 2.8–5.3\% and 1.4–3.0\%, respectively. After controlling for other factors, the model regression analysis also confirms the important increase across years as well as the significant differences of bicycle ridership across neighborhoods. A statistically significant association is also found between the index of bicycle infrastructure accessibility and bike mode choice – an increase of 10\% in the accessibility index results in a 3.7\% increase in the ridership. Based on the estimated models and in combination with a {GHG} inventory at the trip level, the potential impact of planned cycling infrastructure is explored using a basic scenario. A reduction of close to 2\% in {GHG} emissions is observed for an increase of 7\% in the length of the bicycle network. Results show the important benefits of bicycle infrastructure to reduce commuting automobile usage and {GHG} emissions.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.tra.2018.08.022},
	abstract = {There is a growing recognition of the role that walking and cycling can make in reducing greenhouse gas ({GHG}) emissions by substituting motorized travel, particularly on short trips. However, there is a lack of evidence at the micro level on the realistic, empirically derived potential of walking and cycling to displace motorized travel and thus reduce {GHG} emissions. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential for {GHG} emissions savings from replacing short car trips with walking and cycling and the extent to which high quality infrastructure for walking and cycling may influence day-to-day travel decisions, change the spatial and temporal nature of local journeys and impact on overall {GHG} emissions from motorised travel.

To achieve this aim this study conducted an in-depth observational study of a purposively selected cohort of 50 residents in Cardiff, Wales. Using a mixed-method approach detailed quantitative and qualitative data were collected for each participant using personal Global Position System ({GPS}) devices, 7-day travel diaries and contextual interviews over two seasonally matching 7-day time periods in 2011 and 2012. {GHG} emissions for motorized travel modes were derived using journey distance, vehicle technology details and average speeds obtained from the {GPS} data. The spatial and contextual data provided new insights into the complexities of walking behaviour and factors influencing cycling for everyday travel or recreation, including route choice decisions, activity destinations and the role of the new infrastructure to enable change.

We found significant potential of active travel to substitute short car trips, with sizeable impacts on carbon emissions from personal travel. Half of all car trips were less than 3 miles long. Taking into account individual travel patterns and constraints, walking or cycling could realistically substitute for 41\% of short car trips, saving nearly 5\% of {CO}2e emissions from car travel. This was on top of 5\% of ‘avoided’ emissions from cars due to existing walking and cycling. The evolving high quality walking and cycling infrastructure in the case study area was unlikely to promote a significant reduction in carbon emissions from (displaced) car journeys on its own.

The study contributes to the debate on how to achieve stringent low carbon targets in urban transport. The combination of methods for data collection developed and employed in this study also helps to inform future research on the wider environmental impacts of active travel, including ‘co-benefits’ of improved air quality, reduced noise and reduced fossil fuel use.},

The aim of this chapter is to analyze digital electronic media and their effects on environmental sustainability. Two fields of application are addressed: electronic media that may replace or augment traditional print media such as newspapers or magazines, and videoconferencing as a potential substitute for traveling to a face-to-face meeting or conference. In both cases, the
environmental costs of the electronic media are compared to those of their conventional counterparts. The examples show that electronic media can represent an energy-efficient alternative to traditional activities such as long-distance travel. But they can also be added on top of existing activities instead of replacing them. In such cases, a net increase in the environmental impact results. The availability of small, energy-efficient devices being used as electronic media does not guarantee dematerialization. The overall resource use and emissions throughout the life cycle of the media product systems and, more importantly, at the macro level of total global production and consumption need to be considered. To achieve the dematerialization potential of new electronic media solutions, their efficiency needs to be
combined with sufficiency; thus additional measures are necessary to turn the dematerialization potential of electronic media into environmental relief.},

	abstract = {The rapid technological evolution and adoption of consumer electronics highlights a growing need for adaptive methodologies to evaluate material consumption at the intersection of technological change and increasing consumption. While dematerialization and the circular economy ({CE}) have both been proposed to mitigate increasing material consumption, recent research has shown that these methods may be ineffective at achieving net material use reduction: When focused on specific products, these methods neglect the effects of complex interactions among and increasing consumption of consumer electronic products. The research presented here develops and applies a material flow analysis aimed at evaluating an entire “product ecosystem,” thereby including the effects of increasing consumption, product trade‐offs, and technological innovations. Results are then used to evaluate the potential efficacy of “natural” dematerialization (occurring as technology advances or smaller products substitute for larger ones) and {CE} (closing the loop between secondary material supply and primary material demand). Results show that material consumption by the ecosystem of electronics commonly used by U.S. households peaked in 2000. This consumption relies on increasingly diverse materials, including gold, cobalt, and indium, for whom secondary supply is still negligible, particularly given low recovery rates, often less than 1\%. Potential circularity metrics of material “dilution,” “dispersion,” and “demand mismatch” are also evaluated, and indicate that {CE} approaches aimed at closing the loop on consumer electronic material still face several critical barriers particularly related to design and efficient recycling infrastructure.},

	abstract = {Mobility as a Service ({MaaS}) is an attempt to overcome market segmentation by offering transport services tailored to the individual traveler's needs. An alternative to prior investment into single mobility tools, it may allow less biased mode choice decisions. Such a setting favors shared modes, where fixed costs can be apportioned among a large number of users. In turn, car-sharing, bike-sharing or ride-hailing may themselves become efficient alternatives to public transport. Although early field studies confirm the expected changes away from private car use and towards public or shared modes, impacts are yet to be studied for larger transport systems. This research conducts a first joint simulation of car-sharing, bike-sharing and ride-hailing for a city-scale transport system using {MATSim}. Results show that in Zurich, through less biased mode choice decisions alone, transport-related energy consumption can be reduced by 25\%. In addition, introduction of car-sharing and bike-sharing schemes may increase transport system energy efficiency by up to 7\%, whereas the impact of ride-hailing appears less positive. Efficiency gains may be higher if shared modes were used as a substitute for public transport in lower-density areas. In summary, a {MaaS} scheme with shared mobility may allow to slightly increase system efficiency (travel times \& cost), while substantially reducing energy consumption.},

The increase in road freight transportation has resulted in an escalation in the emission of greenhouse gases ({GHG}) into the atmosphere, impacting climate change.

Objectives: The purpose of this article was to investigate the implementation of sustainable supply chain initiatives in reducing {GHG} emissions within the South African road freight transport industry.

Method: This research utilised a case study approach and used primary data, obtained through self-administered questionnaires, to explore the adopting sustainable transport management practices.

Results: The main drivers for implementing sustainable initiatives are pressure from consumer and brand protection, pressure from top management, and cost saving and revenue. Eco-driving, eco-routing and increasing vehicle carrying capacity are the most adopted sustainable supply chain initiatives implemented. The key benefits resulting from implementing sustainable initiatives were operational cost savings, improved competitive advantage and enhanced supplier relationships. Also, the lack of government support, lack of understanding of the cost and insufficient manpower were identified as the foremost challenges associated with the implementation of these sustainable initiatives.

Conclusion: The results reveal that organisations are placed under enormous pressure to implement sustainable practices. This study identifies various sustainable initiatives to reduce {GHG} emissions and addresses the associated benefits and challenges when implementing these initiatives.},

With the consistent growth of e-commerce transactions, more trucks than ever before are entering cities today, bringing with them the negative externalities of increased congestion and pollution. This study first unravels underlying shopping behaviors–both in-store and online–using the 2016 American Time Use Survey ({ATUS}) data. The authors also develop an econometric behavioral model to understand the factors that affect shopping decisions. At a macro level, the disaggregate individual shopping behaviors are studied by implementing the model to synthetic populations to estimate potential vehicle miles traveled and environmental emissions in two metropolitan areas, Dallas and San Francisco ({SF}). Finally, the study estimates the impacts of rush deliveries, basket size, and consolidation levels by developing a breakeven analysis between in-store and online shopping. These results confirm the importance of managing the urban freight system, including delivery services and operations, to foster a more sustainable urban environment.},

	abstract = {The rise of e-commerce has led to substantial changes in personal travel and activities. We systematically reviewed empirical studies on the relationship between online shopping and personal travel behaviour. We synthesised and assessed the evidence for four types of effects on various travel outcomes, including trip frequency, travel distance, trip chaining, mode choice, and time use. In 42 articles reviewed, we found more evidence that online shopping substitutes for shopping travel. Most studies to date have focused on trip frequency but neglected other travel outcomes. Very few studies have considered the modification effect, which has significant implications for travel demand management. In sum, previous studies have not reached a consensus on the dominant effect of online shopping, in part due to the diversity in variable measurements, types of goods, study areas, and analytic methods. A limitation of previous studies is the reliance on cross-sectional surveys, which hinders the distinction between short-and long-term behaviours and between modification, complementarity, and substitution effects. Our study provides an agenda for future research on this topic and discusses policy implications related to land use, behavioural changes, data collection, and modelling for practitioners who wish to incorporate e-commerce in planning for sustainable urban systems. {ARTICLE} {HISTORY}},

To clarify the benefits of vehicle lightweighting we have reviewed the available literature (43 studies). The {GHG} emissions and primary energy results from 33 studies that passed a screening process were harmonized using a common set of assumptions (lifetime distance traveled, fuel-mass coefficient, secondary weight reduction factor, fuel consumption allocation, recycling rate, and energy intensity of materials). After harmonization, all studies indicate that using aluminum, glass-fiber reinforced plastic, and high strength steel to replace conventional steel decreases the vehicle life cycle energy use and {GHG} emissions. Given the flexibility in options implied by the variety of materials available and consensus that these materials have substantial energy and emissions benefits, it seems likely that lightweighting will be used increasingly to improve fuel economy and reduce life cycle {GHG} emissions from vehicles.},

We developed a fleet-based life cycle model to estimate the {GHG} emission changes due to lightweighting the U.S. light-duty fleet from 2016 to 2050, using either high strength steel or aluminum as the lightweight material. Our model estimates that implementation of an aggressive lightweighting scenario using aluminum reduces 2016 through 2050 cumulative life cycle {GHG} emissions from the fleet by 2.9 Gt {CO}2 eq. (5.6\%), and annual emissions in 2050 by 11\%. Lightweighting has the greatest {GHG} emissions reduction potential when implemented in the near-term, with two times more reduction per kilometer traveled if implemented in 2016 rather than in 2030. Delaying implementation by 15 years sacrifices 72\% (2.1 Gt {CO}2 eq.) of the cumulative {GHG} mitigation potential through 2050. Lightweighting is an effective solution that could provide important near-term {GHG} emission reductions especially during the next 10-20 years when the fleet is dominated by conventional powertrain vehicles.},

These gliders were modelled with internal combustion engine vehicle ({ICEV}), hybrid electric vehicle ({HEV}), and battery electric vehicle ({BEV}) powertrains. The probability that using the lightweight glider in place of the conventional (steel-intensive) glider reduces life cycle {GHG} emissions are: {ICEV}, 100\%; {HEV}, 100\%, and {BEV}, 74\%. The extent to which life cycle {GHG} emissions are reduced depends on the powertrain, which affects fuel cycle {GHG} emissions.

	abstract = {div class="section abstract"{\textgreater} This review paper covers major regulatory and technology developments in 2018 pertinent to tailpipe emissions of greenhouse gases and criteria pollutants. Europe has proposed ambitious reductions in {CO}2 limits for both light- and heavy-duty sectors. The challenge is compounded with changing measurement norms and a significant shift away from fuel efficient diesels in the light-duty ({LD}) space. Both incremental and step changes are being made to advance internal combustion. New studies show that in-use {NOx} emissions from diesels can be much lower than required by the Euro 6 regulation. Discussions have already started on Euro 7 regulations, and the leading regulatory concepts and proposed technical solutions are provided.
In the heavy-duty ({HD}) sector, the progress is outlined in improving engine and vehicle fuel efficiency through the {US} Department of Energy’s ({DOE}’s) {SuperTruck} {II} program and other representative studies. Common approaches among the participants include hybridization, waste heat recovery, and both open- and closed cycle incremental improvements. Emissions control focus is on evaluating pathways to achieve California’s contemplated low-{NOx} standards, recently also supported by the {US} {EPA} through the Cleaner Trucks Initiative. The challenge is to reduce cold start and low load emissions, requiring innovative engine and after-treatment system solutions. Leading concepts include close-coupled {SCR} (selective catalytic reduction), use of passive {NOx} adsorbers, integration of {SCR} (selective catalytic reduction) on {DPFs} (diesel particulate filters), low temperature urea or ammonia injection, dual {SCR}, and active and passive thermal management to raise exhaust temperatures. Work is also underway on a new low load certification cycle.
Continued advancement is made on after-treatment components. Aged three-way catalysts ({TWCs}) and diesel oxidation catalysts ({DOCs}) are nearing 90\% conversion at 150 °C. {SCR} catalysts continue to improve both their low temperature conversion as well as high temperature durability. Particulate regulations in Europe, China and India are leading to widespread adoption of gasoline particulate filters ({GPFs}). Lean burn gasoline engines can offer significant fuel economy benefits. {NOx} control is a challenge, and passive {SCR} systems and new catalysts are proposed.},

	volume = {124},
	doi = {10.1007/s10584-014-1104-5},
	abstract = {For agriculture, there are three major options for mitigating greenhouse gas ({GHG}) emissions: 1) productivity improvements, particularly in the livestock sector; 2) dedicated technical mitigation measures; and 3) human dietary changes. The aim of the paper is to estimate long-term agricultural {GHG} emissions, under different mitigation scenarios, and to relate them to the emissions space compatible with the 2 °C temperature target. Our estimates include emissions up to 2070 from agricultural soils, manure management, enteric fermentation and paddy rice fields, and are based on {IPCC} Tier 2 methodology. We find that baseline agricultural {CO}2-equivalent emissions (using Global Warming Potentials with a 100 year time horizon) will be approximately 13 Gton {CO}2eq/year in 2070, compared to 7.1 Gton {CO}2eq/year 2000. However, if faster growth in livestock productivity is combined with dedicated technical mitigation measures, emissions may be kept to 7.7 Gton {CO}2eq/year in 2070. If structural changes in human diets are included, emissions may be reduced further, to 3–5 Gton {CO}2eq/year in 2070. The total annual emissions for meeting the 2 °C target with a chance above 50 \% is in the order of 13 Gton {CO}2eq/year or less in 2070, for all sectors combined. We conclude that reduced ruminant meat and dairy consumption will be indispensable for reaching the 2 °C target with a high probability, unless unprecedented advances in technology take place.},

@article{bajzeljImportanceFooddemandManagement2014,
	title = {Importance of food-demand management for climate mitigation},
	volume = {4},
	doi = {10.1038/nclimate2353},
	abstract = {Recent studies show that current trends in yield improvement will not be su cientto meet projected global food demand in 2050, and suggest that a further expansion of agricultural area will be required. However, agriculture is the main driver of losses of biodiversity and a major contributor to climate change and pollution, and so further expansion is undesirable. The usual proposed alternative-intensification with increased resource use-also has negative effects. It is therefore imperative to find ways to achieve global food security without expanding crop or pastureland and without increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Some authors have emphasized a role for sustainable intensification in closing global 'yield gaps' between the currently realized and potentially achievable yields. However, in this paper we use a transparent, data-driven model, to show that even if yield gaps are closed, the projected demand will drive further agricultural expansion. There are, however, options for reduction on the demand side that are rarely considered. In the second part of this paper we quantify the potential for demand-side mitigation options, and show that improved diets and decreases in food waste are essential to deliver emissions reductions, and to provide global food security in 2050.},

	title = {Climate Benefits of Changing Diet},
	volume = {95},
	doi = {10.1007/s10584-008-9534-6},
	abstract = {Climate change mitigation policies tend to focus on the energy sector, while the livestock sector receives surprisingly little
attention, despite the fact that it accounts for 18\% of the greenhouse gas emissions and for 80\% of total anthropogenic land
use. From a dietary perspective, new insights in the adverse health effects of beef and pork have lead to a revision of meat
consumption recommendations. Here, we explored the potential impact of dietary changes on achieving ambitious climate stabilization
levels. By using an integrated assessment model, we found a global food transition to less meat, or even a complete switch
to plant-based protein food to have a dramatic effect on land use. Up to 2,700Mha of pasture and 100Mha of cropland could
be abandoned, resulting in a large carbon uptake from regrowing vegetation. Additionally, methane and nitrous oxide emission
would be reduced substantially. A global transition to a low meat-diet as recommended for health reasons would reduce the
mitigation costs to achieve a 450ppm {CO}2-eq. stabilisation target by about 50\% in 2050 compared to the reference case. Dietary changes could therefore not only create
substantial benefits for human health and global land use, but can also play an important role in future climate change mitigation
policies.},
