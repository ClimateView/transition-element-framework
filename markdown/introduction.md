<h1 class="cv-h2">Introduction</h1>


In the global response to climate change, the gap between scientific knowledge and practical, effective action remains a critical challenge. Built on the foundation of IPCC climate mitigation strategies, the Transition Element Framework (TEF) bridges this gap by converting complex climate data into a structured, open-source framework that governments worldwide are already using to plan, measure, and implement decarbonisation efforts with clear Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

The TEF is actively applied across dozens of cities and regions, including collaborations with the Swedish Climate Policy Council, the Energy Agency, and the Environmental Protection Agency. By organising IPCC mitigation knowledge into structured elements, the TEF empowers cities, regions, and nations to turn climate goals into standardised, actionable steps that align with both local and global objectives. 

With the TEF, cities can move beyond abstract pledges to a concrete, transparent pathway to climate action, simplifying decision-making and fostering global collaboration.


![Platform Overview](/images/platform.png){.cv-center}

This platform is structured around four interconnected resources: the **Mitigation Compendium**, the **Transition Elements**, the **Applicable Code**, and **Referenced Data** Repository. These resources create a comprehensive pathway that starts with cataloguing IPCC Mitigation Options, refines them into structured elements, operationalizes these elements as programmatic models, and finally supports them with precise, referenced data. This approach ensures that climate strategies are not only well-defined but also readily implementable and backed by reliable information for effective decision-making.

<div markdown>
The **Mitigation Compendium** is a curated collection of the IPCC’s Mitigation Options as outlined by Working Group III in their contributions to AR4, AR5, and AR6. These options form the foundation of climate action. By curating this critical information, we simplify the complexity of climate strategies and lay the groundwork for deeper analysis and application.

**The Mitigation Option Compendium empowers**

- **Ease of access:** Find all IPCC Mitigation Options in one place, streamlining research and decision-making.
- **Navigation:** Climate mitigation strategies are well-organised with comprehensive references and highlights, making them simple to identify.
- **Accessibility:** Essential IPCC knowledge is democratised, making it openly available for deeper analysis.

 Using the Transition Element Framework, each IPCC Mitigation Option is broken down into its essential parts—such as interventions, outcomes, activity shifts, and outcomes. 

The Transition Element Framework's structured approach transforms each Mitigation Option into one or more Transition Elements. By applying this process to all Mitigation Options, the framework generates a comprehensive set of **Transition Elements**. 

The Transition Elements serve as building blocks for practical climate action and are organised into the **Periodic Table of Transition Elements** to visually represent the entire range. Each element in the table corresponds to a specific Mitigation Option, providing a clear and systematic way to understand and apply these options.

<div class="cv-textboxdark" markdown>
**The Transition Elements and Transition Elements Framework enable:**

- **Coherence:** The Transition Element Framework breaks down each IPCC Mitigation Option into structured parts, transforming them into coherent Transition Elements.
- **Integration:** Facilitates understanding and comparison of IPCC Mitigation Options through a cohesive set of Transition Elements.
- **Clarity:** The Periodic Table of Transition Elements visually represents the full set of elements, making the framework intuitive and actionable.

<div markdown>
The Applicable Code resource provides a structured, machine-readable way to describe each Transition Element using YAML models. These models act as the programmatic backbone, allowing users to incorporate climate mitigation strategies into various technological applications such as software for scenario analysis, impact assessment, and more.

**YAML Models: Structured, Adaptable Descriptions**<br/>
Rather than traditional code, the YAML models represent each Transition Element as a clear, standardized format that is both accessible and adaptable. They capture the essential parts of each element—interventions, outcomes, activity shifts—making these strategies actionable within software platforms and other digital tools.  

**Empowering Technological Integration and Application** <br/>
By using these YAML models, developers, policymakers, and other stakeholders can programmatically apply climate strategies in diverse contexts. The models provide a flexible, adaptable framework that makes it easier to build tools for evaluating, simulating, and optimizing mitigation efforts.

**Key benefits**

- **Standardisation:** YAML models provide a consistent structure that simplifies the integration of climate strategies into software solutions.
- **Adaptability:** The open-source nature of these models encourages customization, allowing them to be tailored to different needs, such as for Transition Elements for different industries or modeling circular economy.
- **Innovation and Collaboration:** Open-source access fosters a community of users who can refine, share, and expand upon these models, driving continuous improvement and innovation.
</div>
<div class="cv-textboxdark" markdown>
**Practical Applications**

- **Scenario Analysis:** Use the models to build tools that explore different climate action pathways and their potential impacts.
- **Impact Assessment:** Integrate the structured descriptions into software that assesses the outcomes of specific mitigation actions.
- **Custom Software Development**: Developers can utilise these models to create tailored applications, enhancing decision-making and strategic planning.

Supporting the models, the fourth resource is a repository for **Referenced Data**, which provides reliable, vetted data essential for implementing the Transition Elements. Guided by the structured approach of the framework and the parameters defined by the models, this repository offers precise references and data sources tailored to the needs of each Mitigation Option. This ensures that the data is actionable and consistent with the framework, supporting informed decision-making and maintaining uniformity across different contexts, ultimately improving the likelihood of successful climate action outcomes.

The Transition Element Framework originates from co-innovation between ClimateView, the Swedish Climate Policy Council, the Energy Agency, the Environmental Protection Agency, and dozens of municipal authorities. This collective effort proves that we can overcome fragmentation and complexity together. 

ClimateView’s journey began with collaboration, and now we invite the broader scientific and climate action community to join us as well. By sharing this open-source platform, we aim to create new possibilities for others to use, expand, and build upon the work we have started. Join us in exploring how this framework can be a powerful tool for advancing climate strategies worldwide. We believe that by continuously sharing insights, data, and reasoning, we can act faster and more effectively to achieve our shared goals.
